The beginning was extremely awesome with the music going back to the first one. But, the movie is self-serving and the lead actor which is Tom Cruise is extremely self-serving and egotastic. It could've been managed so much better. I feel that the movie was aiming for a younger crowd that has never seen the first movie to begin with. The attention span of younger viewers is not so great so I understand a bit why but if you're going to do a movie like top gun, do it so right and so amazing that it will go down in history like the first one.

79,2.5,"TopGun 2. For me, this is a story that I hoped would be revisited for a very long time. I cannot even count the amount of times I have watched the original. I can even say that for each time I watched it, I still got those great feelings and that tingle of enjoyment running down the spine. For me, it was not just the story, but also the music, that helped carry the story along in one of the most emmersive and exhilarating movies I have ever watched. 
So, when it was announced that TopGun 2 was coming out - called TopGun Maverick, I couldn't wait for it to arrive. After watching it however, I found myself a little perplexed and underwhelmed. Although the movie was good and there was some amazing footage, CGI and action shots that made you feel you were right there with Maverick and the aircraft in the skies, I kept feeling that something was missing. 
There were several things that has fell short of my expectations. TopGun was such an iconic movie, with some fun, excitment, love, honor, emotion and sadness, however there was always the backbone of reality and a noticable danger in flying jets and pushing it to the limit, that Joseph Kosinski and Tony Scott were able to capture on screen so well. This was of course highlighted by the loss of Goose. 
For me, the new movie was too far removed from reality and leaning too much towards fiction and CGI, which I am sure would sit nicely for the younger audience, but not so much for those who were around when the original was released.  To begin the movie with a fictional aircraft that went to mach 10 or more was a stretch and a quick notification that this movie was going to very different from the original. Then, we had charactors that in my opinion were not strong enough to be in this type of movie. Not sure whether it was because they looked too young for the role, or Glen Powell's charactor, who loved himself far too much and bordering on just silly.  Then we have Tom. For me, Tom played a charactor that was far too close to Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible - rather than Lt. Pete Mitchell. Whether it was the little jokes or facial expressions, the charactor seemed an amalgamation of both of them - although too weighted towards Ethan.
I know the ratings are very good for this movie and I do admit it was good and very action packed, however I guess I am more of the minority rather than the majority in this case. It took me a while to understand what my problem was with this movie and now I think I know why. It is the title that bothers me!
If this was a movie with Tom Cruise who has to train some pilots how to launch some missiles into a hole in the ground, then I am sure it would have been fine and could perhaps even be a mission impossible assignment. However, I do not think it should have been called TopGun Maverick, as I feel the movie is too far removed from the original. A few references here and there to Goose and a connection to his son, was for me, still too weak. There was next to no music at all, which again made the original so iconic, except for one song somewhere in the middle that I forgot about as soon as it finished. 
As much as I love movies with Tom Cruise, this one seems a little lost and way below expectations. If you are going to have a title with TopGun in it, I would expect it to have a closer connection in the original. 
It was good to see at least one of the original charactors made it back from the original. More would have been nice - especially at the funeral. A big tip of the hat to IceMan - Val Kilmer.

This is a movie for the ages. The planes and scenery that I witnessed during this jaw-dropping 2 hours and 11 minutes; especially the Darkstar. I liked many characters, including Maverick and all the other young pilots. The inclusion of younger characters is also important as seeing them will inspire younger generations to follow their heart and dreams. In conclusion, I give Top Gun 2: 5 stars.

So this was a very solid film, with good pacing, great sound effects and music (watched at a friends with surround sound) very similar to the first film in that regard.  There were some edge of your seat moments for sure.

317,3.5,"Like any laid back nester whose watch list plates were already full three months ago when the biggest aviator cinema phenomena was terrifically manifested by four worldwide generations of alpha action movie fans as the highest-grossing film of 2022, those young at heart now mostly in their fifties and beyond know it's better late than never to savour every adrenaline rush and thrill at their home theatre reimagined piloting inside the cockpit of a super hornet ‚Äî Cher would sure want a ride with either or both Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer exclusively in the name of her boyfriendology.

It is easy to settle with Top Gun Maverick if you are a sucker for airborne speeds, navy blues, military friendships and undying bonds plus a little drama of cockfights under the eighties vibe. Like its 1984's predecessor, Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up with the fellow lead cast and co-producer Cruise and director Tony Scott (who'd unfortunately passed away in the early production year) to restore the original bohemian, freewheeling soul of the eponymous character ""Maverick"" with decades of preceding reputation as a steadfast fighter aircraft diehard now summoned to perfect the hard skills of a budding team of special tasked pilots. Haunted by losing his late bestie, his training mate ""Goose""/dad of trainee ""Rooster"" (a strikingly identical Miles Teller as the son of a 36-years younger Anthony Edwards) in the previous accident, ""Maverick"" went against the trial rules and pushed high risk altitude flying to make sure the team know how to make their way back in crisis.

Fans can tell Cruise is physically on par resuming his ageless role, despite tucking away his small belly in two shirtless scenes, but genuinely not shortsighted and qualified still as an aviator. To counter his immortal charm at the best going rate, an equally dateless Jennifer Connelly starred as his interest of heart. Both Ed Harris and Jon Hamm stood out in their uniformed character; the kicking top gun graduates are added with a black-lives-matter conscious and, whether that really matters for any subtext observation, the co-ed team's beach valleyball game scene deliberately recreated and reprised as a famous homoerotic moment in the tradition of the duology films.

And once again just for the fans, new director Joseph Kosinski worked out the Sonantic-enhanced voice of the post cancerous Kilmer and gave his character ""Iceman"" a much respectful departure.

The only disappointment is the totally inappropriate, unnecessary and embarrassing closure soundtrack, I mean, why involved Lady Gaga?!! Her music even as to date is far too incomparable to Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock's ""Take My Breath Away"" performed by Berlin.

The special effects and real cockpit shots from the sky add so much. In theaters in the Dolby made this feel like one of the best experiences I've had in theatres in a while. I took half a star off because it isn't quite original as it follows the same format as the first one. And while it worked, this didn't really add more outside the formula of the first movie. However the movie was just great. Truly a wild ride and the stakes truly felt raised among the cast. Watching them feel the G forces was hilarious and awesome and added to the true terror of what pilots go thru daily.

596,4,"""Top Gun: Maverick"" is an exhilarating film with no pretensions.  It just wants to be a first-rate diversion on a hot, humid summer afternoon.  By that measure, it exceeds expectations.  If you're looking for an existential assessment of the human condition, go see ""Everything Everywhere All at Once.""  If you want to examine the nature and texture of relationships, check out ""Brian and Charles"" or ""Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.""  ""Maverick"" is an unapologetic adrenaline rush that doesn't have time to probe the darker corners of the human psyche.  So just sit back and savor Tom Cruise reprising his most iconic role.
This film works for three reasons: its visuals, its tone and what happens when there aren't jets in the air.  Visually, ""Maverick"" is simply spectacular.  The dogfights and other aerial shots are all real, not CGI.  When you see the g-forces pressing on Tom Cruise's face, that's real.  This commitment to reality makes these action scenes even more riveting.
The tone of the film is equally skilled.  It's self-referential without being self-absorbed.  There's a bar where there are renditions of ""Great Balls of Fire.""  There is beach football substituting for beach volleyball.  The admiral's daughter (referenced in the original but never seen) shows up.  Most of all, there's an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played fighter pilot ""Iceman"" in the original.  Here, he's an admiral whose body is failing because of cancer.  He can speak only with great effort.  (In real life, Kilmer has battled throat cancer.  His brief speaking parts in ""Maverick"" are computer-generated.)
Finally, in ""Maverick"" the story keeps its footing even when it's on the ground.  The original film was littered with excruciating dialogue filled with tortured clich√©s (""Your ego is writing checks your body can't cash."").  And because of Director Tony Scott's advertising background, ""Top Gun"" featured way too many locker room scenes that just looked like product placement for Jockey briefs. By comparison, ""Maverick"" offers a cornucopia of interesting tidbits.  There's a height-appropriate love interest for Cruise. (Jennifer Connelly is excellent.)  There's also a surrogate father-son dynamic between Maverick and Goose's son.  As a special bonus, Maverick appears incrementally more self-aware.  There's even a female fighter pilot vying to become the gender-neutral alpha dog.
The plot is almost an afterthought.  After taking an experimental aircraft to Mach 10 in an opening scene, Maverick is assigned back to Top Gun School to train pilots for a suicide mission.  An unidentified rogue nation is engaging in uranium enrichment.  Maverick has to train pilots who will blow up the enrichment plant before this country can develop nuclear capability that will threaten civilization.  And so on.
A storyline that can be charitably described as ""implausible"" in no way detracts from the fun of this film.  In one of the three (count ‚Äòem, three) climactic scenes, Maverick and his team attack the rogue nation, a country with plentiful evergreen trees and snow on the ground.  The uranium enrichment facility is three minutes from the coast.  Go to the biggest screen you can find to watch Tom Cruise bomb Norway.",Mark H,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,"Aug 21, 2022",Mark H,/user/id/fc8e2b5f-f565-4a49-bd49-a6c34dcb3fee,RT,fc8e2b5f-f565-4a49-bd49-a6c34dcb3fee,

So if that's the benchmark Top Gun Maverick delivered in Spades.

Following that, they didn't mess with the opening credits. They kept it the exact same with the shots of the F-18s taking off from the carrier with Kenny Logging's Danger Zone blasting in the background. Every scene in this movie, every line of dialogue feels completely necessary and fully adds to the movie. The final battle sequence of this movie has also instantly become one of the best of all time.

The music is amazing and the tracks from the original movie take me back to the sounds of the 80s. It shows strong men and women with backbones, and lots of muscle, so refreshing. I also appreciated seeing mature adults with wrinkles. You're told at the beginning that they wanted the audience to have an immersive experience and they did not disappoint. Tom Cruise is a good actor and the look of pure joy on his face when he rode his motorcycle or when he was flying felt genuine.

1232,3.5,"Over thirty years after graduating from TOPGUN, United States Navy Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot. While he has won many honors, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank , with his friend and former TOPGUN rival Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet who often protects Maverick from being grounded. Rear Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain cancels Maverick's ""Darkstar"" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. Before he can officially do so, Maverick sets a new flight plan to push into high-hypersonic speed, accomplishing the program's goal. The prototype is destroyed, however, when he pushes beyond Mach 10. Iceman saves Maverick's career once again by ordering him to NAS North Island for his next assignment, but Hammer warns Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon end. The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, which sits in a deep depression at the end of a canyon. It is defended by SA-3 Goa surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and what appear to be fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57[d] fighters. Maverick devises a plan to attack with two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Although he wants to fly the mission, Maverick is instead asked to train an elite group of TOPGUN graduates assembled by air boss Vice Admiral Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson, who dislikes Maverick's unorthodox methods. Maverick out-dogfights his skeptical students to push them to their limits and to win their respect. Lieutenants Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin and Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller)‚Äî son of Maverick's late best friend and RIO Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw‚Äîclash; Rooster dislikes Hangman's cavalier attitude, while Hangman criticizes Rooster's cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin, to whom he reveals that Rooster's mother made him promise before she died that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster, unaware of the promise, resents Maverick for impeding his military career and blames him for his father's death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career, but the alternative is to allow him to fly in the extremely dangerous mission. He relays his doubts to Iceman who has throat cancer; before dying, Iceman advises that ""It's time to let go"" and reassures him that ""the Navy needs Maverick""...

Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""Top Gun: Maverick pulls off a feat even trickier than a 4G inverted dive, delivering a long-belated sequel that surpasses its predecessor in wildly entertaining style."" Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood called the sequel better than the original movie. The New York Times-based critic A. O. Scott called it a ""thin, over-strenuous and sometimes very enjoyable movie"" and ""an earnest statement of the thesis that movies can and should be great"". Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian: ""Cruise presides over some surprising differences from his first outing as the navy pilot hotshot in a film that's missing the homoerotic tensions of the 80s original"". Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the movie ""another cornball male weepie and military recruitment ad that feels like every WWII movie got fed into an algorithm"", and wrote that the movie ""counts as a worthy sequel in that it succeeds and fails in many of the same ways as the original"" and added that ""the flying sequences are breathtaking enough to make you forget that these guys and gals are engaging in the kind of combat scenarios that start wars."" Entertainment.ie's Brian Lloyd's 4-star review said the film ""exceeds with flying colours"" and ""exists in a world that is all of its own making. There are golden sunsets, perfectly crisp white t-shirts, exquisitely coiffed hair, and long-held flames of romance that make it all impossible to resist."" Clarrise Loughery, chief editor of The Independent, wrote that the film is ""as thrilling as blockbusters get. It's the kind of edge-of-your-seat, fist-pumping spectacular that can unite an entire room full of strangers sitting in the dark and leave them with a wistful tear in their eye."" Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, ""The new film, less of a sequel than a renovation, infuses the 1986 drama of airborne combat with today's politics."" Tomris Larfy of RogerEbert.com wrote, ""Equally worthy of that big screen is the emotional strokes of Maverick that pack an unexpected punch."" Tatsam Mukherjee of Firstpost wrote that the film reminded him of James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari (2019), and commended the coordination between ""man and machine"". He added, ""At the forefront of this clash is a man named Tom Cruise, who wants nothing less than our jaws on the floor. Proving that no amount of multiverse films or superstar cameos will replace the blood, sweat and adrenaline of an actor legitimately trying to push the boundaries of filmmaking. We can be rest assured that if it's a Tom Cruise film, he will not let us down."" Chris Bumbray of JoBlo.com called the film as ""a thrill ride of the highest order"" and wrote, ""If you're a fan of the original, this will blow you away ‚Äì but even if you don't love the 1986 classic (blasphemy), this has a lot to offer."" (via Wikipedia)

This sequel to the 1986 film ""Top Gun"" offers a thrilling airborne ride showing off flying effects that is miles away from the more wobbly effects in the first film. The storyline is as thin as paper (what would you expect and yet three people wrote this script...) and the enemy is now ""unknown"" yet it¬¥s quite clear Russia is the ""unknown enemy"" which is a bit silly to be honest. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" prosper in nostalgia of course and that is ok, but too much is a repetition of what we saw in ""Top Gun"" and the only thing that really stands out is the amazing flying sequences not much else in my book. Tom Cruise is solid as Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, while I think the great Jennifer Connelly ends up too much in the background. It¬¥s nice to see that Val Kilmer got to reprise his Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky role and his real life struggle with throat cancer becomes a part of the storyline. And I think Miles Teller does a good job as Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. I have seen so many 5 out of 5 reviews and I can¬¥t honestly agree to that. This is nothing more than a 3 and a half to me.

1283,4.5,"Cruise's character is a Good Guy/Hero for Everyone. The Bad Guys are bad (I don't think they are even given a country or a name).  So the great thing, the mass appeal, is there are no gray lines, no politics: everyone understands who is Good, who isn't.  Cruise looks amazing as does everyone else. There's a great, heartfelt subplot. The jets are real. There is at least an hour of up-in-the-sky thrills and chills. Oscars? Seems to me the sound editing  and cinematography and soundtrack and Lady Gaga's great closing number, ""Hold My Hand"", are locks  It's time for Cruise to win his acting Oscar, (a career award), as he should have won for ""Born on the 4th of July"" anyway. My only quibble is that ""Maverick"" pretty much marches  lock-step with the original, but is so much better.

1557,2,"It's really cheesy. Like Stilton. 

Minus the swearing I'd say this is a great film ... for 6 year old boys. 

It's got planes, it's got fast cars, it's got dad issues throughout and it even has the odd boat thrown in - for what reason I still can't quite figure out. I'm sure the lads in the audience will be grateful though.

I don't know why they couldn't market this to a younger audience to be honest, it would have been absolutely perfect. There's plenty of cheesy characters delivering typical one-liners who seem to live in a military/pilot town where nothing really ever happens other than going into work and getting drunk. Everyone knows each other etc. 

The plot line is simple, so simple that there really isn't much going on and I'd advise you to leave your brain at home. Otherwise you'll be guessing (correctly) what's about to take place next, and well, where's the fun in watching a film where you already know what's going to happen?

Let's just say it's simplistic to the point that I was slightly confused how the film producers managed to get away with it. Films are largely a lot more complex nowadays, even children's films have sophisticated story lines that keep audiences enthralled and guessing what will happen next. This film is pretty much a 2 minute story line dragged out into a 2 hour film. Its got some cool film shots of planes flying really high in the sky though. And I'm grateful on this occasion the 'enemy' is a faceless, placeless generic naughty nation, which doesn't play upon ingrained racist stereotypes. I'm also grateful that there's a simple and sweet love interest story featuring an 'older' couple ... That gave the film a slight degree of depth, but then this also precludes it from being shown to my 6 year old boy as it's a little risqu√© for super young audiences ...

""The decorated captain, hated by his superiors, the bar (fight), the competition among some cadets/pilots for recognition and rank, the intermittent love affair and of course the unnamed enemy who is threatening the world peace, with, of course, the annihilation of that evil guy/organisation or installation at the end. Same story as aaaaaalways. When Tom appears before the movie, doing an intro and explaining that the movie took 15 years in the making, one naturally expects something different and better, but the only thing better were the flight scenes, which nowadays anyone can find even in any decent video game.

It play perfect homage to the original movie without just being a movie that relies on nostalia. If you are a child of the 80s and saw the original back then, the movie will definitely have a bigger impact on you, but it's not required. The movie stands on it's own.

Some people did not like the romance that was involved since it felt forced..but I had no issue with it. Since 30 years have past, throwing in something that would link to something that happened during that time was not a problem for me - even though we didn't know those characters...it still worked out fine for me.

When my wife asked my daughter why she likes the movie so much, my 7 year old said 1) It was her favorite movie ever, 2) she loves the music, 3) and she likes the leather chairs and air conditioning in the movie theater. Couldn't have said it better myself. Personally, I've seen Top Gun Maverick 27 times and still going! The visits just kind of piled up without thinking about it... Kind of like going back to ride a roller coaster at the amusement park over and over again. Multiple times with various friends and family. Just kept going back for more. It's a very addictive movie. A total masterpiece... It's still my favorite movie ever. I still get choked up at the same spots in the movie after the 27th time! The only time I have seen a movie even twice in the movie theater was Matrix 1 in 1999. So it's been awhile. Top Gun Maverick is also now my favorite soundtrack of all time as well. Just trying to enjoy it as much as possible before it leaves the big screen. I cannot imagine watching it on a small ipad screen in mono sound. That would be an insult. I still get awed by the level of inspiration it provides, totally uplifting.. It really comes down to... would you see an absolute masterpiece by somebody at the top of their game (Tom Cruise) over and over again, picking up little distinctions each time, in total awe? or go watch that re-cycled green screen crap once? For example, Cruise is continuing to evolve his live action chase sequences with elements from the Mission Impossible Fallout helicopter chase scene at various flight sequences of Top Gun Maverick. Simply awesome. At this pace, Top Gun Maverick has a chance of cracking the top ten best selling movies of all time worldwide. Let's see how it holds up from here. There's a reason why rotten tomatoes critics gave Top Gun Maverick 97, and the general audience gave it a 99. Getting people to agree on anything these days is like herding cats. I truly feel bad for people that miss this experience in the theaters. Hopefully enough people go see this movie so that it makes a loud statement to the big movie companies and they switch us out of this wokeness trend into a new more normal one!!

2649,5,"My 7 year old daughter dragged my wife and me back to see Top Gun Maverick again yesterday. It was her 7th time and my wife's 7th time also. When my wife asked my daughter why she likes the movie so much, my 7 year old said 1) It was her favorite movie ever, 2) she loves the music, 3) and she likes the leather chairs and air conditioning in the movie theater. Couldn't have said it better myself. Personally, I've seen Top Gun Maverick 27 times and still going! The visits just kind of piled up without thinking about it... Kind of like going back to ride a roller coaster at the amusement park over and over again. Multiple times with various friends and family. Just kept going back for more. It's a very addictive movie. A total masterpiece... It's still my favorite movie ever. I still get choked up at the same spots in the movie after the 27th time! The only time I have seen a movie even twice in the movie theater was Matrix 1 in 1999. So it's been awhile. Top Gun Maverick is also now my favorite soundtrack of all time as well. Just trying to enjoy it as much as possible before it leaves the big screen. I cannot imagine watching it on a small ipad screen in mono sound. That would be an insult. I still get awed by the level of inspiration it provides, totally uplifting.. It really comes down to... would you see an absolute masterpiece by somebody at the top of their game (Tom Cruise) over and over again, picking up little distinctions each time, in total awe? or go watch that re-cycled green screen crap once? For example, Cruise is continuing to evolve elements from the Mission Impossible Fallout helicopter chase scene at various flight sequences of Top Gun Maverick. Simply awesome. At this pace, Top Gun Maverick has a chance of cracking the top ten best selling movies of all time worldwide. Let's see how it holds up from here. There's a reason why rotten tomatoes critics gave Top Gun Maverick 97, and the general audience gave it a 99. Getting people to agree on anything these days is like herding cats.

2793,4.5,"I remember when Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) was released, and despite my lack of interest in the whole series, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Part of the reason for this was the fact that it was essentially a retreading of the original Star Wars film, A New Hope (1977), which is probably my favourite of the franchise, and it was done very well. Top Gun: Maverick is similar in the sense that it follows the original 1986 film (which is not a great film, but it's certainly a cult classic with plenty to enjoy in it) almost beat for beat; you can probably guess most of the plot from the first sequence onwards. It is a straight sequel though, Tom Cruise's Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to train the ‚Äòbest of the best' to undertake a potentially suicidal mission to blow up a uranium enrichment plant in a plan that supposedly requires not one but two miracles to be successful. The film isn't subtle, much like the original, it's laugh out loud funny at times and Maverick hasn't changed his approach to life or authority. The thing is however, is that Top Gun: Maverick is absolutely fantastic cinema. Especially if you're a fan of the original, you'll (subjectively) be gripped from minute one. The fact that Tom Cruise is sixty this year adds to the astonishment that a sequel not far off forty years in the making is this good. The actions sequences are jaw dropping, the actors (old and new) embellish the spirit of the Top Gun world, and, possibly most effectively, the emotional heft of the film is superbly judged, making several sequences (including one with a returning Val Kilmer) genuinely difficult to get through without really feeling it. There was a round of applause towards the end of the film in the screening I was at, as well as several whoops; something I would usually turn my nose up at, but I couldn't do anything but completely get on board with the reaction.

2866,2.5,"I was shocked to find the first half of the movie was quite mediocre. The end was very good and so I left the theater satisfied, but this was not the great movie that everyone claimed.  

The best scene was between Cruise and Val Kilmer. The old players brought their skills to the screen as always. 

But Tom Cruise did not have chemistry with the new people in the cast .The leading lady especially had no  spark with Tom and it was almost as if he had no romantic storyline because there was no heat or connection between them, which contrasted so much with all the fire he had with Kelly McGillis in the first film.

 I missed the flirtation and sex appeal of the first film because this one had none. So that part of Maverick's personality was muted.  The scenes of the female lead throwing Maverick  out of the bar and treating him badly in the bar came off mean, not flirty or fun. It's amazing how this character's flritations were so empty and cold. 

Also, Cruise had no chemistry with MIles Teller, who was the wrong cast for Goose's son. Teller was not likeable and someone else could have given the character more sympathy and fun. The ""fun"" scenes with Teller it didn't translate because his energy isn't fun. And the fight on screen was ridiculous writing because someone mentioning Maverick killed your father would be no reason to fight. . 

The supporting cast lacked pinache period. In the first movie from the 80s everyone was cool, full of personality, and easy on screen --- as 80s actors were apt to be. This younger crew  of Top Gun graduates in the Maverick film were artificial on screen. And the female one came off harsh and robotic. They tried too hard and the acting was noticeably contrived. None of their scenes will ever be memorable or quoted like the ones in the first film. 

The callbacks to the original movie were too paint-by-the-numbers to be touching, entertaining or nostalgic. It's both the fault of the writers and the director. 

The director was too obvious in his touches in many ways, such as how he zoomed in repeatedly on characters glancing at each other in a moment of concern or doom, which became comical. These zooms  with the unnecessary commentary from cast underscored things too much and lacked subtlety.

Top Gun: Maverick is an action packed, exhilarating journey that will leave you with a sense of awe that most sequels can fail to do. It is definitely a must watch for all fans of the original, and for anyone else who loves the excitement of cinema. The movie isn't perfect and has its fair share of tacky Americanized romance, but even though it can be cringe at times, it does not effect the otherwise brilliant plot. So be ready to sit on the edge of your seat and experience a beautifully shot, wild ride of joy, heartache, and downright electric thrill.

*spoiler* review

The montage that kicks off the film definitely sets it up to be a marvel in cinematography - when it comes to fighter jets that is. The scenes where characters are flying are immersive and stunning to look at, not to mention very fun, and every last one of them left me on the edge of my seat wanting more. Even throughout the rest of the movie good camera techniques and strong depth of fields are used on faces to really single out characters and let the audience analyze them, a useful technique for the plot where the audience is trying to decide their positions on the individual pilots. 
The plot itself was very good, and the situation set up between Maverick and Rooster was a perfect link to the last film and a strong narrative, performed brilliantly by Tom and Miles. Right from the get go I was enthralled and captivated by the story they had set up with the mission, and even though it was quite predictable that they would succeed and probably all survive, the stakes felt so high that it was still extremely  entertaining to watch play out. Certain scenes left my heart beating out of my chest with fear!
The plot falls however when it comes to the side romance story. If the movie has a big problem it's this for me. The romance felt forced, extremely cringe and tacky, and unbelievable predictable. Cool guy meets girl he used to date, they are both single, he can't mess it up this time, and they are in love. What happens? Oh they get together at the end, kiss while leaning against a Porsche, and literally fly into the sunset lol. However even though it was a generic and predictable side story, the rest of the movie was so entertaining that honestly I didn't mind it too much, and it fits in with the genre, but I would have liked to see a change there and was disappointed. 
Last few notes are that I was very impressed with all the diverse cast of actors, and thought they did a brilliant job!
I also really loved how after making that one enemy jet extremely hard to kill due to a skilled enemy pilot, when their plane was eventually shot down they ejected, not going to lie after they pulled that missile evasion I was rooting for them haha.

Look, I like Tom Cruise movies, and will suspend belief for every Mission Impossible action scene, but this movie?-meh. Maybe because I am an ex-sailor from San Diego who works in government programs now, every silly thing made me roll my eyes. 1) Two star admirals don't just up and cancel billion dollar Lockheed flight programs.  McCain was a senior senator, and even he couldn't cancel the crappy LCS program.  Way too many people, politics and 4 star Admirals involved.  2)  After 3 years away as a test pilot, you don't get to just jump in an F-18 cockpit - you have to requalify and recertify.  3)  ""The Best of the Best"" fly F-35s now (but the Navy let the movie makers use F-18's, so you work with what you got).  4) I'd believe a kid could get bit by a spider and get powers before I believed in a single mom, dive bar owner with a $90K vintage 911, a $220K sailboat and a $6 million house on the water in Ocean Beach.  And super-hot and single, to boot.  Don't want any silly real-life relationship issues to get in Maverick's way.  5) Iceman gets buried in Rosecrans National Cemetery, which has been full for decades - you can still get an urn with your ashes placed there, but no more caskets.  6) An F-14 defeating not one, but 3 next generation fighters, supposedly SU-57s would be like a '68 Camaro winning a formula 1 race. Can't happen, no matter who the pilot is.  Maverick would have a better chance in his P-51 beating 3 F-18s.

The incredible 4D dives and amazing flight sequences are intense and shot in such thrilling fashion.

Top Gun: Maverick has already firmly cemented itself as a classic that will endure and be remembered for decades to come, all by making a movie that blends old-school sensibilities with new-school technology to create the perfect summer blockbuster; that is to say a movie that not only has heart-pounding action and spectacle, but a good, heartfelt story that makes you care about what happens to the characters throughout said action.

Top Gun: Maverick is so full of cliches that it ends with that king of cliches: the crowd clapping to main character.  And it's complete with: a girl in a Porsche at Sunset, smart ass dialogue in a bar, ""evil"" countries, and on and on. This is the kind of movie that later on South Park will use for their next World Police sequel.

And like I said, the selling point of this movie so far has been the fact that Tom Cruise pilot its own airplanes, as if a movie would have to be real.

They absolute get the Tone right which every sequel/remake movie these days gets wrong (ie Halloween, Star Wars). I can't give it 4 or 5 stars though because it's the little things that this movie gets wrong that take away from the movie's effectiveness. It deviates from the tone established in a couple scenes and therefore makes you no longer worries for the characters, which takes away the thrill and leaves you not caring. There is a lost opportunity for Miles Teller's character to finally empathize with Tom Cruise and it's missed. And finally, they end the movie with a Lady Gaga song. It's not even a bad song, but when you have one of the greatest theme songs in cinema history and you don't end on it, you've lost me. This is an homage to the 80s tough guy era and to end this epic ride with a song about ""holding hands"" was almost a joke and ruined the movie for me. It's a fun movie and worth seeing but I wish they took the time during its 2 and a half year delay to rethink these little issues that ended up taking away a lot from the film.

Maverick doesn't get the pilot love story, but it does have a lot of amazing flying scenes. This is a movie you don't want to think too much about, otherwise you will spend a few hours thinking about how this whole mission could very easily, and safely, be achieved with a simple cruise missile strike, or you'll scratch your head at how a US Navy captain can afford a multi-million dollar P-51 Mustang.

All the un logical action scenes could have been shot in front of a green screen and nobody would have noticed nor cared. The most shocking thing is that it's obvious that rotten tomatoes has been sensitive to bribery over the past ten years, with movie studios offering money in exchange for good reviews.

4851,5,"Top Gun: Maverick is a message to modern cinema: Good movies make money. You don't need to rely on insanely high stakes and loads of explosions to make a good movie. You just need well written characters. And Top Gun: Maverick has those, spending a surprisingly large amount of time establishing them, which I believe is a very good thing. It also has great jet scenes that, instead of focusing on having the fate of the universe on the mission's shoulders, are entertaining because you care about the characters (and the jet tricks are pretty cool). I wasn't a fan of the first Top Gun, but this is an amazing movie. It feels so much like an older movie in all the right ways, while having the advantages of modern cinema. It never feels too long, it never milks nostalgia (though will be nostalgic for fans of the first movie), and it never forces political messages down your throat. It just focuses on being a good movie, which every movie should aim for, but very few modern ones actually try to achieve. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is a fantastic movie that will hopefully teach a lesson to Hollywood: Stop milking nostalgia and just make a great movie with realistic characters.

Tom Cruise is solid throughout, bringing back glimpses of his physical performances from decades ago and being one of the few action movie heroes in recent movie history that isn't tainted by bizarre motivations or political narratives. Miles Teller is also fantastic and exudes Goose in his every movement. Another point that's sorely missed in most modern films is patriotism, which is subtly but clearly on display in the reverence the film shows to the military.

4930,4,"After 36 years the sequel to the original ‚ÄòTop Gun‚Äô is finally here directed by Joseph Kosinski with Jerry Bruckheimer executive producing again Tom Cruise returns to one of his most popular roles from the ‚Äò80s playing Lt. Pete ‚ÄòMaverick‚Äô Mitchell of the Air Force while also co-producing He‚Äôs assisted by a much bigger cast this time from Jennifer Connelly to Miles Teller to John Hamm to Glen Powell The first film directed by the late Tony Scott was memorable for its hit song ‚ÄòDanger Zone‚Äô and the exhilarating fighter jet sequences not to mention the banter between him and Val Kimer‚Äôs Lt. Tom ‚ÄòIceman‚Äô Yet when it wasn‚Äôt doing that the drama on the ground was less than stellar with characters being kinda shallow So the sequel this time has ‚ÄòMaverick‚Äô being an instructor inspiring future pilots at Fighter Pilot School aka Top Gun Everyone though has doubts and he has a huge weight on his shoulders if anything happens to them while in training He also reunites with his former flame Penny Benjamin Under orders by the new admiral Maverick has 3 weeks to train these pilots to destroy a supply of uranium without engaging in enemy fire; their training will push them defying gravity, air speed, pressure, and trying to avoid dog fights in aerial combat Goose‚Äôs son, Rooster has a chip on his shoulder and perfectly so since he blames his father‚Äôs death on Maverick which he‚Äôs had a hard time letting go The film opens with the same 80‚Äôs energy of movie 1 which is good to get back to basics This definitely does many things miles higher than the first film The fighter jet sequences are way more intense putting the viewer in the cockpits going up, down, sideways and all the various aerodynamics The sound editing and mixing is brilliant giving off that intensity of these aircrafts The drama is actually legitimate and doesn't ground everything to a halt Cruise still owns this role but learning now that being cocky has its disadvantages and there's even a touching cameo by an actor from the original that feels like a perfect sendoff This movie kinda pushes it being over 2 hours long but it still delivers the fun summer popcorn feels that the original director Tony Scott established I absolutely loved Lady Gaga‚Äôs number in this too Cliched ending aside and being over 2 hours this is way more of a coherent piece of character drawing and more exhilarating spectacle piece This was absolutely worth the wait!

4990,1,"Awful. Terrible acting, terrible plot, predictable, shlocky; a steaming pile of cinema. When I read some of the reviews of this movie, I wondered if I suffered through the same bad acting, the hackneyed cornball testosterone-soaked crap that they did. The scene in the bar was as awful as any I've seen in a while--a rehash of the original, corny, trite, clearly aimed at intellects that are amazed when they successfully button their shirts.

After half this awful waste of money (including mine), we left; my wife and I both gave it a 50 out of 100, and the more I thought about it, the lower the rating plunged. 

Waste no time going to this movie.
Nothing is better than this movie.
The writer of this movie has more talent in his whole body than I do in my little finger.

Curious: what happened to the wrinkles on Cruise's face? When he spoke to the audience before the film, he had lots of them; in the movie, he looked about 30. I wonder how many millions were spent with CGI, removing all the wrinkles and turkey neck.

How come Cruise, who was in his 20s in the original (which came out 36 years ago), shows up and immediately hooks up with the bar owner who looks about 30 or 35? I thought she was his daughter (he's a scientologist, so who the h*ll knows)...",Bob P,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,1,"Jul 05, 2022",Bob P,/user/id/950701220,RT,950701220,

It was just really well done and not campy - the storyline was perfect - it was a great way to bring in all the fighter jet scenes. They did a good job of paying homage to the original without being super sappy. The scene with Iceman was my favorite - if Tom Cruise is going to ever get nominated for any acting roles, I would nominate him for that scene alone. In fact, if this movie doesn‚Äôt get nominated for ANY categories, then Hollywood, why even bother making another movie?
