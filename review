41,3.0,"If you're a fan of Tom Cruise, Top Gun and the '80s (which I am), it's worth seeing. It was a very nostalgic homage to all of those things, including Kenny Loggins' signature single. It has very likeable characters, great action and amazing stunts that kept me on the edge of my seat at times. I also enjoyed seeing Jennifer Connolly (on whom I had a big crush back in the day). Having said all of that, the movie is a recycling of the original Top Gun and other 80s movies. The characters are clichd and the plot is fairly predictable. For this reason, I was rather bored during the movie's first half, the character-building portion of the story. The second half was more exciting when it explored some real risk and skill. Though, I have to say that the premise for the mission is taken straight right out of Star Wars: A New Hope.

Reminiscing on the porch with a heavy, aging meemaw would really detract from the go-go kickass pace of the film. So they bring in Jennifer. The most reality defying moments are all in the action at the end of the film where Mav gets shot down along with his wingman but manage to just waltz right onto a bombed hostile base and take off in a still functional F-14.

241,1.5,"Tom Cruise has lost that loving feeling. There's more to being Maverick than fancy flying. 
This movie was impressive, but not enjoyable. You have to compare it to it's 1986 progenitor and it doesn't hold up well. Cruz has lost the swagger and charisma of Maverick and there is no wingman to give him a boost. There are so many great storylines that could have emerged from 2986 TG but sadly they went with the least interesting and probable. Hero is still a hero, but now less compelling. Hero has a much younger romantic interest but there's no romance there. The ""mission"" stakes are undefined and the threat isn't immediate. The hero saves the day in the most unlikely way and the good guys lose nothing. 

The jets are better, the actors are prettier but the soul of this movie is hollow. Everything that made the 1986 movie great (drama, romance, comedy, danger, consequence, originality, music) is missing from this one. It speaks volumes of how bad cinema has gotten that this dud of an action flick has been rated so highly.",Stop T,False,False,False,False,1.5,5d ago,Stop T,/user/id/Google_112299416582123690001,RT,Google_112299416582123690001

429,3.0,"""Top Gun: Maverick"" was fantastic all I hoped it would be. It was evenly paced, IMPRESSIVELY photographed, had a good story line and hit all the ""high"" spots--paying tribute to the original very well. 

However, the IMAX theater where I viewed the movie (AMC IMAX, Springfield MO) has a completely inadequate sound system for rendering the audio portion of the supposedly ""immersive"" experience. The volume was too high this was evident in a most obvious way repeatedly in two types of scenes: 

1) whenever there was dialogue, it seemed like the actors were speaking at a volume high enough to be heard 'across a room' instead of face to face. The volume was so high there was no chance for tone or inflection to create an emphasis--like a whispering voice might imply something secretive or important--""what"" whisper?? not in this theater. If this was done in order to alleviate closed captioning, it was an utter failure.

2) in the action scenes, the volume was up so high distortion was complete and painfully annoying in the screeching rendition of whatever was showing on the screen--tires might screech during a high-speed chase but an approaching plane doesn't. Loudness is fine, and required in many movie scenes, but the accompanying high pitched scream should not be a screech of distortion--one that sounds almost like fingernails on a chalkboard--that's the sound of speakers mismatched with an amplifier being played too loud. Like AMC IMAX. Someone made the decision to spend less than required on the audio system and it's plainly apparent in the ""loudness"" at this theater. 

I've been on the deck directly beneath some of the Blue Angels stunt team when they pulled out of their dive. ""THUNDER"" doesn't begin to describe the immense volume and dB level that 4 jet engines put out. But they didn't screech like this theater's audio system, nor was it annoying nor painful to hear them like the rendering at AMC IMAX Springfield, MO.","AMC IMAX Springfield, MO sound system blows chunks",False,False,False,False,3.0,6d ago,"AMC IMAX Springfield, MO sound system blows chunks",,Fandango,d0f0358d-fef2-4b8a-a488-cd1615226d57
